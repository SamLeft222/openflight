"""Regression tests for the net-impact serial deadlock (field failure).

A real shot produces a second loud sound ~1s after impact (ball hitting the
net). With the old ordering, the radar was re-armed immediately after its
dump was read, so the net impact re-asserted HOST_INT and started a new 41KB
dump exactly when the post-capture clock-sync exchange wrote C? commands to
the port. With no write_timeout on the serial port, serial.write() blocked
forever (confirmed by py-spy: capture thread stuck in serialposix write via
read_clock_sync), the radar wedged mid-dump, and the system never re-armed.

Fixes under test:
1. The serial port opens with a write_timeout so no write can hang a thread.
2. read_clock_sync survives a write timeout and returns an unusable summary.
3. SoundTrigger talks on the wire (clock sync) BEFORE re-arming — while the
   radar is idle after its dump and HOST_INT pulses are harmless — and
   re-arms last. Rejected/false triggers skip clock sync and re-arm fast.
